# STT-TTS-Ibm-Watson

First I will talk about IBM Watson :

It is a computer system for artificial intelligence capable of answering questions asked in natural language developed by the DeepQA project at IBM. Watson was named after Thomas Watson, president of IBM. So I used IBM Watson in my project to make the (Speech to text) and (Text To Speech).

So the fourth task in "Smart Methods" is to create a: 

1- Use python language in IBM Watson to convert (Speech To Text) and Text to Speech 


2- save output text from (Speech To Text)  as .text file 


3- save the output speech from (Text To Speech) as .mp3 file 



The steps to make the project is to download the following requirements: 

1- Python Language . 


2-install STT and TTS from IBM Watson 


3-pyaudio


4- websocket-client
